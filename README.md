# Letter-Frequency-Counter
This is a simple C++ program that:

Takes a sentence or paragraph input from the user.

Saves the input text to a file named story.txt.

Reads the file back and counts the occurrences of each letter (case-insensitive).

Displays the frequency of each letter (a to z) in the console.

How It Works
The program prompts the user to enter text describing their day.

It writes the input text to story.txt.

It opens story.txt and reads it character by character.

It converts uppercase letters to lowercase.

It counts how many times each letter appears.

Finally, it prints the count of each letter to the console.
